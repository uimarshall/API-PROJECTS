<!-- WHAT OUR APPLICATION WILL DO -->
<!-- We will have a front-end either mobile app or just webpage,
we will input our latitude, longitude, our area etc, this will be used by the mobile app to form a GET request to our API
the APi will say i've got a GET request, i want to return list of ninjas in a json format that is within
certain radius of the data provided and we return it to the mobile app for diaplay it on their screen to users. -->

<!-- Our application will be built using express framework running on Node.js(javascript)
just like building a flask app running on python, so once we install express using npm
as we install flask using pip, it opens a lot of resources including http request mtds, routing etc -->

<!-- REQUIREMENTS -->
<!-- 1. Database/MongoDB
it will store the ninjas and their properties
2. API - Express/Node.js, the API will be built with "express", a package we can install,
express is just a package that makes life more easier for us, so anything we do wt express,
we can do without it only that it makes things easier.
"npm install express --save" - this will install express & save it in our package.json file
3. front-end/3rd party app - it will make the request, the front-end will do ffg:
-Create a new ninja and send it to the API which will in turn store it in the Db- POST request
so on the mobile app or webpage you will input the latitude & longitude and press SEND, it will send a GET
request, the API will handle it and goto the database and get the resource and sent it back to the 3rd party app
-Reading/ retrieving a list of ninjas - GET request
-Update/ edit an existing ninja - PUT request
-Delete a ninja from the Db - DELETE request -->

<!-- OUR API ROUTES -->
<!-- When communicating with an API, we have to make request to certain route or endpoints that the API exposes to us
Read/retrieve a list of ninjas:
-GET request to http://www.ninjago.com/api/ninjas-this is what the API exposes to us togo and grab the list of ninjas
Create a new ninja:
-POST request to http://www.ninjago.com/api/ninjas
Update/ edit an existing ninja:
-PUT request to http://www.ninjago.com/api/ninjas/Id
Delete a ninja
-DELETE request to http://www.ninjago.com/api/ninjas/Id
 -->

 <!-- WHAT HAPPENS IF WE SEND A REQUEST TO THE SAME ROUTE? -->
 <!-- How does the express app knows whether to delete or update, read or create.
 We use http request method to achieve this as specified in the request, we say which type?:
 $.ajax({
     method: "POST",
     url: "http://www.ninjago.com/api/ninjas",
     data: {name: "Harry", rank: "Red Belt"} 
 })
 $.ajax({
    method: "GET",
    url: "http://www.ninjago.com/api/ninjas",
    data: {name: "Harry", rank: "Red Belt"} 
}) , with this the server knows what to do with the request-->




<!-- The package.json file is going to track info abt our project and all the dependencies -->
<!-- Assuming you have television = "Application"
Remote Control = "Interface" to interact with the tv(the app) e.g to change stations
You need a human being to press the Remote Control
Hence you have "Application(tv) Human Interface(Remote)" -->

<!-- Incase of API -->

<!-- Assuming we want to interact with YouTube(app), we want to search for a particular Video,
so YouTube(TV) provides us with this endpoint(Interface, REMOTE) for us to interact with it:
https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search(interface),
instead of pressing the button of our "Remote" to interact with YouTube,
We write a program to fetch what we want in the YouTube thru the interface(endpoints)
provided by YouTube,instead of human doing the job, the program does it.
Hence we have "Application Programmable Interface"
So tv provides Remote for us to press and interact with tv.,
While Youtube provides endpoint we can use programming code to interact with. -->

<!-- REST
REpresentational State Transfer
It is a standard/set of guidelines by which we can structure & create API's
It is an Architectural style of the web
It has identifiable properties... -->

<!-- what are the properties?
1. They make use of Resource-base url
The resource cud be a webpage like html page:
http://www.bbcsports/football/scores, this is just a GET request to fetch this endpoint(scores)
so instead of going to the site and navigate to the "scores" page, we write to programmable
code to fetch it and instaed of the browser consuming(displaying) it,
we now consume it in our own application like in pretty JSON Form.
the "scores" is the resource we actually want and return it in a JSON form for instance -->

<!-- REST PROPERTIES
1. They make use of HTTP Methods:
-GET- Used to retrieve data from the server
-POST- Used to send data to the server
-PUT- Used to Update data
-DELETE- Used to delete data

2. They make use of HTTP Status Codes:
Examples:
- 200 means OK
- 400 means resource not found
- 500 means server error -->

<!-- HTTP METHODS -->
<!-- It is a way of telling the server which type of request we are making -->
